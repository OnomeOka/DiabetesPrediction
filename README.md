Diabetes is a serious and chronic health condition affecting millions of people worldwide. Early detection and timely management of diabetes can significantly improve the quality of life of patients and prevent long-term complications. In this context, machine learning algorithms can serve as powerful tools for predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals. The diabetes dataset used in this study contains 768 instances and 9 attributes, including the outcome variable indicating whether the individual has diabetes or not This project aims to identify the best model among the implemented models to predict whether a patient is prone to diabetes within the next five years. The following models were implemented: 
1.	Logistic Regression
2.	K- Nearest Neighbour
3.	Support Vector Machine
4.	Decision Tree
5.	Random Forest
To evaluate and compare the models, several metrics extracted from the confusion matrix of each model will be used.
